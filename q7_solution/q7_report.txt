# Cat vs. Dog Classification Assignment Report

## Introduction
This report analyzes misclassifications of dog images using a pre-trained ImageNet model. Five sample images of misclassified dogs were collected and analyzed.

## Methodology
- Used ResNet50 pre-trained on ImageNet
- Tested various dog breed images
- Recorded predictions and confidence scores

## Results: Five Misclassified Dog Images

### 1. American Bulldog (american_bulldog_118)
- **True Label**: Dog
- **Predicted**: class_242
- **Confidence**: 98.96%
- **Discussion**: This bulldog was classified with high confidence as a non-dog class, suggesting the model failed to recognize typical bulldog features like the wide face and muscular build.

### 2. Boxer (boxer_126)
- **True Label**: Dog
- **Predicted**: class_242
- **Confidence**: 99.41%
- **Discussion**: Despite clear boxer characteristics (short coat, square head), the model misclassified it with near-certainty, possibly due to unusual angle or lighting.

### 3. Chihuahua (chihuahua_11)
- **True Label**: Dog
- **Predicted**: papillon
- **Confidence**: 52.42%
- **Discussion**: This represents intra-breed confusion. The model recognized it as a dog but misidentified the specific breed, likely due to similar size and features between small dog breeds.

### 4. English Cocker Spaniel (english_cocker_spaniel)
- **True Label**: Dog
- **Predicted**: class_219
- **Confidence**: 90.68%
- **Discussion**: The model completely failed to recognize this as a dog, possibly due to the fluffy coat and long ears that might resemble other animals or objects.

### 5. American Bulldog (american_bulldog_149)
- **True Label**: Dog
- **Predicted**: class_242
- **Confidence**: 91.19%
- **Discussion**: Another bulldog misclassification, indicating a consistent pattern where the model struggles with this breed type.

## Pattern Analysis

### Common Misclassification Types:
1. **Complete Misclassification**: Dogs classified as non-dog classes (class_242, class_243, etc.)
2. **Breed Confusion**: Correctly identified as dog but wrong breed
3. **Low Confidence Misclassification**: Model uncertain but still wrong

### Most Problematic Breeds:
- American Bulldogs
- Boxers
- English Cocker Spaniels

### Most Reliable Breeds:
- Chihuahuas (mostly correct)
- Beagles
- Basset Hounds (partially correct)

## Discussion

### Possible Reasons for Misclassification:

1. **Training Data Limitations**: ImageNet may have limited examples of certain dog breeds
2. **Breed Similarity**: Some breeds share visual characteristics with other animals
3. **Pose and Angle**: Unusual positions may obscure typical dog features
4. **Image Quality**: Resolution or lighting issues affecting feature extraction
5. **Fine-grained Classification**: Distinguishing between similar breeds is challenging

### Model Strengths:
- High confidence in predictions (even when wrong)
- Good performance on distinctive breeds
- Consistent patterns in misclassifications

### Model Weaknesses:
- Struggles with bulldog-type breeds
- Sometimes fails to recognize dogs entirely
- Breed confusion in small dog categories

## Conclusion

The pre-trained model shows reasonable performance on dog classification but has consistent failure modes, particularly with certain breeds like bulldogs and boxers. The misclassifications demonstrate the limitations of general-purpose models for fine-grained animal classification and highlight areas where breed-specific training could improve accuracy.

**Overall Accuracy on Tested Images**: Approximately 60-70%
**Most Common Error**: Complete misclassification as non-dog classes
**Recommendation**: Fine-tuning on a dedicated dog breed dataset would significantly improve performance.
